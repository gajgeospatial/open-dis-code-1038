<span style="font-weight: bold;">Introduction</span><br>
<br>
This directory contains Java and C++ code to implement the Distributed
Interactive Simulation (DIS) IEEE-1278 standard, which is often used in
military simulations.<br>
<br>
The code (both Java and C++) consists of two portions. The protocol
code itself consists of classes that represent Protocol Data Units
(PDUs). These classes have fields, getters, and setters, and are able
to marshal and unmarshal themselves to and from the DIS binary format.
This code was automatically generated via XMLPG, a tool that generates
Java and C++ code automatically from an abstract XML description. This
code is in the java and cpp directories.<br>
<br>
The second portion of the code is supporting classes that read and
write PDUs from the network, initialize the PDUs, and set the position
and orientation of PDUs, and scripts and build files that compile the
code. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">XML Description File</span><br>
<br>
The XML file that is an abstract description of the protocol classes is
in DIS1998.xml. This file is used by XML Multi-Language Protocol
Generator
(XMLPG), which is available at the <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=86243">XMSF's
sourceforge.net </a>site for download. <br>
<br>
The XML file is processed by XMLPG and writes both the Java and C++
protocol code. The idea is to use the XMLPG tool to get the final
product "close", and then manually modify the source code in subversion
to tweak the last bit.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Java</span><br>
<br>
The Java protocol classes are in the java directory, under the package
edu.nps.moves.dis. The code is generated by&nbsp;&nbsp; XMLPG's ant
build file. Install ant and type "ant"; this will compile the code and
generate a jar file on the dist directory.<br>
<br>
Supporting Java files are in the edu.nps.moves.examples directory. This
contains
two simple programs that read and write DIS Entity State PDUs. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">C++</span><br>
<br>
The C++ code is in the Cpp directory. The prefab C++ implemenation uses
the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">DIS</span>
namespace to contain the protocol code. The Compile directory contains
Microsoft Visual C++ build files, which allows the code to be compiled
and linked to a dll or executable. The CppUtils directory contains
supporting files for the DIS protocol, including a data stream class
for marshaling and unmarshaling, a factory class, and some simple
example code that generates Entity State PDUs. Simple unit test code is
also available in the UnitTestDIS directory.<br>
<br>
2.0 Release Notes:<P>

Added support for reading and writing data in XML format. Use the class
at edu.nps.moves.disutil.XmlReadWrite to read and write DIS PDUs
to and from XML format. The approach taken was to use Sun's
JAXB to create parallel classes for all the existing open-dis
classes, and add code for creating jaxb objects from open-dis
objects, and vice versa. Also, a JAXB-generated schema is provided
in DisJaxbSchema.xsd in the root directory.<p>

Other changes include some minor bug fixes; Emitter is now spelled
correctly, and the Fire PDU has a field that was missingl earlier
provided now. A couple classes have had their case changed, UAPdu
to UaPdu and APAPdu to ApaPdu, to allow compatablity with jaxb.

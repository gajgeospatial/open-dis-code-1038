<h1 style="text-align: center;">Darkstar with Distributed Interactive
Simulation</h1>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. What's Darkstar? </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<br>
Darkstar is Sun's attempt at a massively multiplayer online game
toolkit. The web site is at <a href="http://projectdarkstar.com.">http://projectdarkstar.com.</a>
The underlying idea is to provide a toolkit that allows developers to
infinite or near-infinite size. They haven't yet demonstrated that yet,
so I'm agnostic on the claim. On the other hand, the odds are good that
it's OK for perhaps a few hundred entities, and that covers a lot of
applications.<br>
<br>
Darkstar uses a database on the server side to hold persistent
objects.&nbsp; Multiple hosts on the server side can share access to
the database, allowing scale-out in CPU cycles; if you want more AI or
collision detection on the server side, you simply add more
hosts.&nbsp; The use of a persisent database adds some interesting
capabilities, such as transactional capability on object modifications
and the ability to compelety power down the server, restart it, and
have all your objects come back.<br>
<br>
Darkstar is server-centric; generally speaking, it likes all
communications to go through the server, and likes decisions to be made
on the server side. This is in line with most contemporary game
platforms. If nothing else, the potential for cheating in commerical
games makes any and all input from the client side suspect, much less
game ajudication decisions like whether someone was shot. The DIS
protocol, in contrast, tends to make peer-to-peer decisions about
things like shooting results. We haven't yet quite figured out how to
resolve the conceptual mismatch. But, hey, that's what research is all
about.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. What's DIS?</span><br>
<br>
Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) is a widely used Department of
Defense modeling and simulation protocol. It is a wire format; the
exact layout of data on the wire is specified for a few dozen Protocol
Data Units (PDUs).&nbsp; We've written an open source implementation of
the DIS protocol for Java, C++, and C#. You can get some pointers to
further DIS documentation at the open-dis site, <a
 href="http://open-dis.sourceforge.net">http://open-dis.sourceforge.net</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. What software is included?</span><br>
<br>
This release has two parts, a server side and a client side. Both have
netbeans project folders. <br>
<br>
In the server directory, it's generally best to start it up from the
command line. There is a build.xml ant file with two tasks defined,
"ant clean-datastore" and "ant start". The first completely wipes out
the server side persistent database. The second starts the darkstar
server. The server program starts up darkstar, adds some DIS-style
entities to the persistent object store, and adds several tasks for
things like heartbeat and tick. It also opens a DIS-specific
communications channel that accepts DIS packets from a darkstar client
and adds an entity to the persistent object store if entities described
in the PDU are not found. The entities hosted on the server side send
out periodic heartbeat ESPDU packets. <br>
<br>
The database used on the server side is Berkeley. There are native
libraries included for many development platforms; I've been developing
on OSX. JDK 1.6 is required.<br>
<br>
The client project opens a connection to the darkstar server and
establishes a connection that is used for DIS packets. <br>
<br>
On both the client and the server the open-dis package (in java) is
used to encode and decode DIS.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Future work</span><br>
<br>
Lots. We're kicking around the idea of using darkstar as a permanent
virtual world. The scalablity of Darkstar is unproven, but it's
probably good enough to go to a few hundred DIS entities, and that's
not all that bad for a lot of applications. If it can scale to
thousands or tens of thousands, we'd be estatatic. <br>

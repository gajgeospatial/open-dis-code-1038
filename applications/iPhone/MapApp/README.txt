This directory holds what is, at this point, some experimental code for
using DIS on an iPhone. It uses the MapKit API of the 3.1 OS.

This directory includes source code for DIS, but the cannonical location for
DIS code is still the open-dis directory on sourceforge. That contains the
definitive source code releases for Java, C#, C++, and Objective-C.

Open-DIS implements the IEEE DIS protocol in multiple languages.

Open-DIS is an open-source implementation of the Distributed Interactive 
Simulation (DIS) IEEE-1278 standard in C++, C#, Objective-C, Java, Javascript 
and XML. 

Example applications including sending and receiving native DIS traffic, X-Plane 
plugin, and WebSocket/Javascript/WebGL applications.

The open-dis-languages.zip file includes source code for the Java, C++, Objective-C,
and C-Sharp implementations. Build systems appropriate for each language
are included.

The XplaneDisPlugin.zip file includes the source code for a plugin to X-Plane,
a high resolution, low-cost flight simulator by Laminar Research. See 
http://www.x-plane.com for details.

The DisWebSockets.zip file contains a simple web-based networked virtual 
environment that uses WebGL, WebSockets, and Javascript. This is an experimental
research and development project investigating new technology. It is similar
to the WebLVC study group sponsored by SISO; see
